# Planned changes

Changes the downstream analyst (`civ-strategy-analyst`) needs from the
logger. None of them blocks that project: where a fallback exists it is a
guess this repo could replace with a fact, and where none exists the
analyst simply does without that analysis. Ordered by how much guessing
they remove.

## Emit tourism and cultural influence in the snapshot

The snapshot carries culture per turn but nothing about tourism, so
cultural-victory progress is invisible: who pressures whom, how hard, and
how close anyone is to winning. The Lekmod DLL exposes the full BNW
culture API to Lua (`CvLuaPlayer.cpp`): `GetTourism()` (per-turn output),
`GetInfluenceOn(other)` / `GetLastTurnInfluenceOn(other)` (accumulated
influence, delta gives the rate), `GetInfluenceLevel(other)` (Exotic →
Dominant), `GetInfluenceTrend(other)`, `GetTurnsToInfluential(other)`,
and `GetNumCivsInfluentialOn()`.

Add to `civ.playerStats`: `tourism`, `civs_influential_on`, and an
`influence` list with one entry per living major opponent —
`{civ, points, level, trend}`. That is the one snapshot field that grows
with player count, but at 8–12 majors the record stays small.

Consumer fallback: none. Culture per turn says nothing about tourism
output or influence standings.

## Extend the snapshot with the Demographics screen's inputs

The in-game Demographics screen shows empire-wide figures players watch
as trend indicators, and the snapshot carries only some of their inputs.
The screen's own source (`LEKMOD/Lua/tmp/ui/Replays/Demographics.lua.ignore`
in the mod repo) gives the formula for every row, and each function it
calls is exposed to Lua: production and food are
`CalculateTotalYield(YieldTypes.YIELD_PRODUCTION / YIELD_FOOD)`, GNP is
`CalculateGrossGold()`, population-in-millions is `GetRealPopulation()`,
land is `GetNumPlots() * 10000`, and approval, literacy and army are
arithmetic over fields the snapshot already carries (`happiness`, `techs`,
`military_might`).

Add the four missing raw inputs to `civ.playerStats`: `production`,
`food`, `gross_gold` (the existing `gold_per_turn` is net), and `plots`.
The derived display figures stay on the consumer side — the raw values
are what an analysis wants anyway.

Consumer fallback: none for production, food and land — no event carries
them. Gross gold, approval and literacy are partially derivable, but only
by guessing at expenses and at the ruleset's total tech count.

## Emit a city census, so razed cities stop haunting the data

The Lekmod DLL fires no hook for a city being destroyed: `CvCity::
DoRazingTurn` calls `CvPlayer::disband` (`CvPlayer.cpp:6778`), which
contains no `CallHook`, and none of the 49 hooks the DLL does fire covers
destruction. A razed city therefore stays in any reconstruction built
from `city_founded` / `city_captured` forever.

`PlayerDoTurn` already runs once per player per turn, and `Player:Cities()`,
`GetNumCities` and `GetCityByID` are all exposed to Lua. Keeping a census
between turns and emitting `city_destroyed` when a known city disappears
closes the gap without touching the DLL, and would also catch anything
else the hooks miss.

Consumer fallback: the per-turn `snapshot` carries `cities`, so the
analyst can tell that a city vanished, and when — but not which one.

## Emit the map dimensions in `session_started`

`Map.GetGridSize()` returns the width and height. Civ 5 maps wrap in X, so
without the width no consumer can measure the distance between two cities
correctly: in the one game logged so far, ignoring the wrap turns a
compact Iroquois empire (span 10 across the seam) into a sprawling one
(span 40).

Add `map_width` / `map_height` to `civ.gameSettings()` in
`src/adapter.lua`, alongside the existing `map_script` and `map_size`.

Consumer fallback: the easternmost plot any event mentions, plus one.
That is a lower bound, not the width — the analyst flags it as an
estimate.

## Emit the active mod's version in `session_started`

`Modding.GetActivatedMods()` returns the mod's ID and version. The
analyst injects LEKMOD ruleset reference data into its prompt and must
know which version's data to use; today the version is passed by hand on
the command line and is simply wrong if the operator misremembers.

Consumer fallback: a `--lekmod-version` flag at import time, which is
where the guessing happens.
